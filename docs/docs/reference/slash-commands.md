description: Gateway slash commands reference (instant, no LLM)
---
Kazma's gateway intercepts slash commands and resolves them **instantly (&lt;50ms)** without any LLM call. Commands that involve `kazma_core` tools (marked `[core]`) are processed by the agent's tool layer with minimal overhead.

> **Web research:** deep research also has gateway/UI entry points (`/research deep …`, Web `/research` panel). Prefer normal chat or those entry points rather than inventing ad-hoc slash variants. See [Web research](../guide/web-research) and [Recent features](../guide/recent-features).

## Documents {#documents}

Surfaces the shared **Document Intelligence** platform (`DocumentIngestionService`)
via `/documents` (alias `/docs`) across Telegram, Discord, Slack, and other
gateway chats. Reads use opaque IDs; no raw server paths from the user.

| Subcommand | Usage | Description |
|---|---|---|
| *(help)* | `/documents` | Help + recent documents |
| `list` | `/documents list` | List id, title, state |
| `status` | `/documents status <id>` | Job/document durable state |
| `read` | `/documents read <id>` | Paged fenced content when ready |
| `convert` | `/documents convert <id> <format>` | Convert to pdf/html/docx/markdown |
| `pdf-info` | `/documents pdf-info <id>` | Structural PDF report |
| `redact` | `/documents redact <id> <term[,term…]>` | Physical redact → new artifact |
| `search` | `/documents search <library> <query>` | Search an indexed library |
| `health` | `/documents health` | Capability + worker readiness |

Alias: `/docs …` accepts the same subcommands.

## 🔄 Session Commands

### `/reset`

Clears the current conversation history. The agent forgets everything and starts fresh.

**Usage:**
```
/reset
```

**Response:**
```
🔄 Conversation has been reset. Starting fresh.
```

**Side effects:**
- All messages in the current thread are cleared from the agent's context.
- Memory items (RAG) are NOT cleared — only conversation history.
- Snapshot history is preserved (use `/replay clear` to purge snapshots).

**Required permissions:** None. Available to all users.

---

### `/undo`

Removes the last agent response from the chat. Pops the last user–bot exchange from the message tracker.

**Usage:**
```
/undo
```

**Response (success):**
```
🔄 Last response removed.
```

**Response (nothing to undo):**
```
📭 Nothing to undo — no recent responses.
```

**Side effects:**
- The dispatch tracker's last entry is popped — `/undo` on the same response twice returns "Nothing to undo."
- The platform-level message deletion depends on adapter support (Telegram: `deleteMessage`).

**Required permissions:** None.

---

### `/edit`

Replaces the last agent response with corrected text. Pops the old response and stores the new text.

**Usage:**
```
/edit The corrected response text goes here.
```

**Response (success):**
```
✏️ Last response edited to:

The corrected response text goes here.
```

**Response (missing text):**
```
✏️ Usage: `/edit <corrected text>` — provide the new text.
```

**Response (nothing to edit):**
```
📭 Nothing to edit — no recent responses.
```

**Side effects:**
- The message tracker pops the last entry.
- On Telegram, uses `editMessageText` for in-place editing if the adapter supports it.

**Required permissions:** None.

---

### `/replay`

Time-travel debugging: list snapshots, restore from a specific iteration, compare two runs, or clear snapshot history. Snapshots are captured after every supervisor iteration automatically.

Sub-commands:

| Command | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `/replay list` | Show all snapshots for the current thread |
| `/replay <N>` | **Restore** — rewind the live thread to iteration N (later turns are lost; use `/fork` to preserve them) |
| `/replay compare <A> <B>` | Diff two snapshots (messages, cost, model, routing) |
| `/replay clear` | Purge all snapshots for this thread |

### `/fork`

Branch from a snapshot into a **new thread** — the original stays intact.

| Command | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `/fork <N>` | Fork from iteration N into a new thread (seeded with the snapshot state + session context; appears in the Web UI sidebar) |

**Usage:**
```
/replay list
/replay 3
/replay compare 1 3
/replay clear
```

**Response (`/replay list`):**
```
🕰️ *Available snapshots:*

• Iteration `1` — 2026-06-26T14:30:00 — file_write: app.py
• Iteration `2` — 2026-06-26T14:31:15 — git_commit
```

**Response (no snapshots):**
```
📭 No snapshots available for this thread.
```

**Response (`/replay clear`):**
```
🗑️ Cleared 5 snapshot(s) for this thread.
```

**Dependency:** The `SnapshotRecorder` is wired into all graph-build sites by default (enabled via `time_travel.enabled: true` in `kazma.yaml`). If disabled:
⏳ Time travel not yet available.
```

**Required permissions:** None.

## `/ide` — IDE Coding Commands

**Where handled:** `kazma_gateway/agent_handler/commands.py:_try_ide_command`
(intercepted in the gateway, skips the graph — same path as `/swarm`).

All `/ide` commands drive the transport-neutral `IdeService` in
`kazma_core/ide/`. Mutating/executing operations (`edit`, `delete`, `run`,
`git`) flow through the shared `LocalToolRegistry` + HITL danger-tool gate.

### Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ide` | Show help with all subcommands |
| `/ide ls [path]` | List a directory in the workspace |
| `/ide open <file>` | Read a file (shown in a code block) |
| `/ide edit <file> <text>` | Write content to a file (HITL-gated) |
| `/ide delete <file>` | Delete a file or directory (HITL-gated) |
| `/ide run <command>` | Run a shell command in the workspace (HITL-gated) |
| `/ide runfile <file>` | Run a script with its inferred interpreter |
| `/ide grep <pattern> [glob]` | Regex search the workspace |
| `/ide git <subcommand>` | Run a git subcommand (HITL-gated) |
| `/ide repo` | Manage workspaces (list, switch, clone, activate by slug) |
| `/ide skill [name] [file]` | Run a coding skill (refactor-file, write-tests, fix-lint, code-review) |
| `/ide swarm <task>` | Dispatch a coding task to the swarm |

### Examples

```
/ide                              → shows help
/ide open kazma_core/ide/service.py → reads the file
/ide edit config.yaml "key: value" → writes (HITL approval required)
/ide run pytest -q                → runs tests (HITL approval required)
/ide repo clone Mubder/kazma      → clones + activates as workspace
/ide skill write-tests kazma_core/ide/service.py → generates tests via swarm
```

**Danger-tier operations** (`edit`, `delete`, `run`, `git`) require HITL
approval — the same gate as the agent and swarm. See AGENTS.md §7.

**Available on:** Telegram, Discord, Slack, Web (chat), TUI.

## Command Lifecycle

1. User sends text starting with `/`.
2. `MessageDispatcher.resolve()` calls `is_slash_command()`.
3. For gateway-handled commands: `resolve_slash_command()` returns the response instantly (&lt;50ms).
4. For core-tool commands (`/personality`, `/context`): the dispatcher returns `None`, the message flows to the agent graph, and the tool layer processes it.
5. If no command matches, the text is passed to the LLM as normal.

## Adding a New Slash Command

1. **Gateway-level** (no LLM call needed): Add a handler in `kazma_gateway/slash_commands.py`:
   - Add a `_cmd_<name>()` function.
   - Register it in `resolve_slash_command()`.
   - Add it to `_cmd_help()` output.
2. **Core-level** (needs tool access): Add a handler in `kazma_core/tools/` and register it in the tool registry.

## Permissions

All slash commands listed here require **no special permissions**. They are available to every user in every chat. For tool-level access control (HITL gated tools), see `kazma_core/permissions.py`.
